40156068,The dual role of titanium particles in osteolysis: implications for gene therapy in prosthesis loosening.,"Aseptic prosthesis loosening caused by wear particles is a major complication in patients with osteoarthritis following total joint replacement. Despite advancements in treatment, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, and effective therapies are still lacking.
In this study, we investigated the effects of titanium particles on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Our findings revealed that titanium particles not only promote the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts and enhance the secretion of inflammatory factors but also inhibit the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts and reduce the expression of Wnt signaling pathway-related factors. Furthermore, using a mouse model of knee prosthesis loosening and AAV-mediated gene therapy, we demonstrated that the combination of TNF-α interference and Wnt3a overexpression was more effective than single-gene therapy in reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, promoting bone formation, and mitigating bone destruction.
These results highlight the dual role of titanium particles in periprosthetic osteolysis and underscore the potential of a gene therapy strategy targeting both inflammatory factors and the Wnt signaling pathway to improve knee prosthesis loosening. This study provides a scientific foundation for developing novel therapeutic approaches.",European journal of medical research,2025
40155982,The comparison of three dimensional and two dimensional evaluation of varus/valgus stress X-rays following total knee arthroplasty.,"The purpose of this study was to compare three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) evaluation of the stress X-rays following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
This prospective study analyzed 51 consecutive rTKAs (four males and 44 females, both aged 74 ± 6 years). Postoperative varus/valgus stress X-rays were taken at maximum manual varus/valgus stress during knee extension under anesthesia, and were analyzed three-dimensionally using a 3D-2D image matching technique with 3D bone and component models. The 3D models of the femur and tibia, along with component-bone constructs, were reconstructed from CT data using 3D modeling software. The 2D evaluation of varus/valgus stress X-rays were carried out directly on the stress X-rays. The varus/valgus angle (VV angle) between components, Medial joint opening (MJO) and lateral joint opening (LJO) were assessed under conditions of no stress, valgus stress, and varus stress.
The VV angles under no stress, valgus stress, and varus stress in 3D and 2D evaluation were 3.6 ± 1.1 / 3.6 ± 1.1°, -0.6 ± 1.6 / -0.6 ± 1.6°, 7.1 ± 1.9 / 6.8 ± 2.5°, respectively. The MJO in the non-stress condition and under valgus stress in 3D and 2D evaluation were 0.0 ± 0.5 / -1.8 ± 0.8 mm,1.4 ± 1.0 / -0.2 ± 1.4 mm, and the LJO in the non-stress condition and under varus stress in 3D and 2D evaluation were 0.9 ± 1.0 / -0.6 ± 1.0 mm, 3.5 ± 1.9 / 2.1 ± 1.9 mm, respectively.
This prospective study revealed that the 3D evaluation of varus/valgus stress X-rays following total knee arthroplasty is equivalent to 2D evaluation in VV angles, whereas different from 2Devaluation in MJO and LJO.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,2025
40155353,"The Role of Health Psychology in Surgical Prehabilitation: Insights From REST, a Preoperative Sleep Intervention for Total Knee Replacement Patients.","Approximately 10%-34% of people experience chronic pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Prehabilitation approaches that address pre-operative risk factors for chronic post-surgical pain are a key area for research. To be effective, prehabilitation requires substantial engagement and behaviour change by patients, which can be challenging in the pre-operative period. Health psychology theory plays a valuable role in understanding how best to support behaviour change to achieve maximum patient benefit. This study provides insights from REST, a pre-operative sleep intervention for TKR patients.
In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight TKR patients who took part in the REST feasibility trial. An abductive analysis approach was used to identify the applicability of existing health psychology theories, and to explore new insights into the relationships between stages of behaviour change.
Three thematic areas related to intervention engagement and enactment were identified: (i) health beliefs and readiness to change; (ii) from contemplation to enactment: the role of behaviour change techniques; (iii) and behavioural maintenance.
Findings highlighted three key stages of behaviour change that participants need to be supported in to benefit fully from prehabilitation intervention. Complex behaviour change interventions that include aspects of tailoring should consider the boundaries of acceptable adaption while maintaining core causal mechanisms, and include methods to explore real-world implementation and usability during the development process. These findings are important for surgeons and multidisciplinary teams to consider when developing new prehabilitation care pathways or when implementing evidence-based prehabilitation practices.",Musculoskeletal care,2025
40154583,Comparing Functional Recovery Between Total and Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Prospective Health Kit Study.,"Both total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) have demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes for end-stage osteoarthritis. Although UKA has been shown to have lower survivorship, many patients are interested in a partial knee arthroplasty due to the perception of ""better"" function and a ""quicker"" recovery. The purpose of this study was to objectively compare and understand functional recovery between TKA and UKA through the utilization of cutting-edge technological health metrics.
Over a two-year period, 185 patients undergoing TKA or UKA (152 versus 33, respectively) were prospectively followed for one year postoperatively. Smart devices were worn by these patients to track their daily steps, steadiness, standing time, six-minute walk test, and gait speed, and were averaged weekly at multiple time points ranging from immediately preoperatively to one year postoperatively. Propensity matching scores were conducted in a 1:3 UKA to TKA ratio, resulting in a final cohort of 120 patients undergoing TKA or UKA (87 versus 33). Additionally, Euroqol 5 dimension survey (EQ-5D) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) scores were compared between groups.
No differences existed between demographics in both groups. At six weeks postoperatively, the mean gait speed was quicker for patients who underwent a UKA in comparison to those who underwent a TKA (0.97 versus 0.89 meters / second, P = 0.02). Furthermore, the average steadiness at six weeks postoperatively was better in the UKA group when compared to the TKA cohort (0.60 versus 0.40 (0 to 1 scale), P = 0.03). No further differences were demonstrated between groups at the 6-week time point. No data or reported outcomes varied between the UKA and TKA cohorts at both 6-month and 1-year postoperative time points.
This prospective study compared UKA and TKA through the incorporation of real-time objective technological data. Although steadiness and gait speed were better in the UKA group at the 6-week follow-up, no differences existed beyond this time point. This study demonstrates that both UKA and TKA had the same recovery and functionality in regards to gait speed, daily step counts, standing time, steadiness, and the 6-minute walking test at 6-month and 1-year follow-up.",The Journal of arthroplasty,2025
40153784,Convergent and Known-Groups Validity and Sensitivity to Change of the Virtual Performance Measure in Patients With Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis: Longitudinal Study.,"Subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a different approach to health care utilization was required to improve safety and efficiency. In the postpandemic era, virtual care and remote assessment of musculoskeletal conditions has become more common, and examining the accuracy of these remote encounters remains vital. In 2023, an innovative, video-based tool-the Virtual Performance Measure (VPM)-was introduced to assess the functional difficulties of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee joint. Further validation of this tool is warranted to expand its application longitudinally and in more diverse populations.
This study examined the longitudinal validity of the VPM, a digitally based outcome tool, in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee joints who had undergone arthroplasty.
Patients completed a web-based survey after watching 40 videos that demonstrated 10 functional tasks with increasing difficulty, prior to and at approximately 3-5 months following surgery. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) was used as the reference measure. Longitudinal convergent and known-groups validity as well as sensitivity to change were assessed.
The data of 120 patients (n=80, 67% female; mean age 67, SD 9 years; n=58, 48% with hip osteoarthritis and n=62, 52% with knee osteoarthritis) were examined. There was a statistically significant improvement in both LEFS (t<sub>119</sub>=16.04, P<.001) and VPM total scores (t<sub>119</sub>=13.92, P<.001) over time. The correlation between the postoperative LEFS and VPM scores was higher (r=0.66; P<.001) than the correlation between the change scores of these measures (r=0.51; P<.001). The area under the curve value for the VPM's ability to differentiate between urgent and nonurgent candidates for surgery was 0.71 (95% CI 0.57-0.84). Sensitivity to change as measured by the standardized response mean was 1.27 (95% CI 1.09-1.45), indicating good ability to detect change over time.
The VPM demonstrated sufficient longitudinal convergent and known-groups validity as well as sensitivity to change in patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis following arthroplasty. This tool has a potential to improve the delivery of care by increasing access, reducing the frequency of in-person visits, and improving the overall efficiency of the health care system following a major surgery.",JMIR formative research,2025
40153477,Risk of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting After Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty Under Spinal Anesthesia: Randomized Trial Comparing Conventional Antiemetics with or without the EmeTerm Bracelet.,"Acupoint stimulation has been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after various types of surgeries involving general anesthesia, but whether the same is true after orthopaedic surgery involving spinal anesthesia is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare PONV rates and the quality of recovery between patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under spinal anesthesia receiving conventional antiemetics alone and those receiving antiemetics combined with use of a transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation bracelet (EmeTerm; WAT Medical Enterprise).
Patients at moderate or high risk for PONV, including 195 patients undergoing THA and 153 patients undergoing TKA, were randomized to receive routine antiemetics (dexamethasone and ondansetron) alone or with use of the EmeTerm bracelet. The primary outcome was the PONV incidence within 24 hours postoperatively; secondary outcomes included the rates of severe PONV, antiemetic rescue, adverse events, and Quality of Recovery scores.
Combining antiemetics with the EmeTerm bracelet significantly reduced PONV (16.0% compared with 31.2%; p = 0.001), severe PONV (1.1% compared with 8.1%; p = 0.002), and antiemetic rescue (3.4% compared with 13.9%; p = 0.001). Use of the bracelet reduced the risk of PONV within 24 hours by 61% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.63), and its benefit became significant at 0 to 3 and 3 to 6-hour intervals after surgery. The complete response rate was higher for the bracelet + antiemetics group compared with the group with antiemetics alone (84.0% compared with 68.8%; p = 0.001), with better Quality of Recovery scores at 24 hours in the bracelet + antiemetics group.
The EmeTerm bracelet enhanced the efficacy of antiemetics in reducing PONV after THA and TKA under spinal anesthesia and may improve short-term recovery.

40153059,Thromboprophylaxis in patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities post total joint arthroplasty.,"Thromboprophylaxis has significantly reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Recent studies have established protocols for VTE prevention using aspirin, given its comparable efficacy to prophylactic anticoagulants and a lower risk of bleeding complications. However, patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) or skilled nursing facilities (SNF) after TJA may require more potent agents due to an increased risk of VTE. This study aims to compare the incidence of symptomatic VTE and postoperative complications in TJA patients receiving aspirin versus anticoagulants in the setting of IPR and SNF.
We reviewed an all-payer, national database for patients who had hip and/or knee osteoarthritis who underwent primary TJA between October 1, 2015 and April 30, 2021 (n = 713,548). Patients discharged to IPR or SNF were identified using CPT codes. A propensity score match was performed to limit potential confounders. Patients were stratified into aspirin (n = 2,343) and anticoagulant (n = 2,343) cohorts based on the postoperative VTE prophylaxis they received; anticoagulants included dabigatran, enoxaparin, heparin, rivaroxaban, and warfarin. Complications were identified using ICD-10 codes and included VTE, aseptic revision, cardiac complications, periprosthetic joint infections, surgical site infections, the need for transfusion, and wound complications 90 days after surgery.
The aspirin cohort had a VTE incidence of 4.4% compared to 2.3% in the anticoagulant cohort (p <.001), indicating nearly double the odds of VTE with aspirin use compared to anticoagulant. The odds ratio for VTE was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37-0.72), with the aspirin cohort as the reference. Incidence rates of other complications were similar between the two cohorts.
This study demonstrates a higher risk of VTE with aspirin compared to anticoagulant in patients discharged to IPR or SNF after primary TJA. Surgeons should consider using rivaroxaban, enoxaparin, heparin, dabigatran, or warfarin for VTE prophylaxis instead of aspirin in these high-risk patients.",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,2025
40151962,External femoral rotation of 2 degrees is associated with the lowest stuffing rates around the femur in functionally aligned TKA.,"Modifying femoral morphology after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) poses a potential risk for ligament-imbalances and patella mal-tracking. The purpose of this study was primarily to quantify TKA-induced stuffing around the femur and secondarily assess the effect of femoral rotation (FR) on trochlear and condylar anatomy-changes.
Knee anatomy-modification was quantified in 69 robotic-assisted TKAs utilising tibia-based functional alignment (FA). Caliper-measurements were performed on the medial (Med), central (Ctr), and lateral (Lat) sides of the following resection planes: anterior trochlea (AT), oblique trochlea (OT), distal condyles (DC), posterior condyles (PC) and tibia (TIB). The same caliper-measurements were performed on the femoral components used to calculate bone-implant differences and analyse possible patterns of postoperative trochlear anatomy-modifications (TAM) and condylar anatomy-modifications (CAM). Over- or understuffing analysis for different FRs and regression analysis were conducted to assess the effect of FR on CAM and TAM.
TAM results were Lat-AT -3.2 mm ([95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.71 to -2.63], p < 0.001), Ctr-AT 0.7 mm ([95%CI: 0.22-1.32], p = 0.02), and Ctr-OT -1.7 mm ([95%CI: -1.85 to -0.93], p < 0.001) with stuffing > 2 mm in 60.9%, 39.1%, and 39.1%, respectively. CAM results were Med-DC -3.6 mm ([95%CI: -4.14 to -3.05], p < 0.001) and Lat-PC 3.0 mm ([95%CI: 2.48-3.38], p > 0.001) with stuffing > 2 mm in 78.3% and 63.8%. FR (3.8 ± 2.6°, range: -1.6° to 8.5°) affected mostly the anterior (r = -0.40, p < 0.001) and posterior (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) aspects of the knee but hardly the OT plane (r = 0.06, p = 0.624) and the trochlear groove to its full range of flexion (r = 0.21, p = 0.17). External FR 2° was associated with the lowest incidence of femoral stuffing > 2 mm and ≥ 4 mm.
FA-typical modification-pattern was a TAM with lateral facet understuffing, and CAM with medial distal understuffing and lateral posterior overstuffing. Trochlear groove height was non-significantly affected by FR. FA with the current off-the-shelf implant induces the lowest stuffing rates when set in 2° external femoral rotation.

40151740,Persistent Fear and Extended Swing Phase During Stair Descent Following Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Report.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is widely recognized as an effective procedure for reducing pain, improving activities of daily living (ADLs), and enhancing the quality of life in elderly patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis (KOA). However, many patients continue to have trouble with stair descent after TKA, a key functional movement that significantly affects postoperative satisfaction. This report describes the case of an 80-year-old woman with bilateral KOA who underwent left TKA. Despite undergoing postoperative rehabilitation, she continued to experience functional impairments and fear while stair descending, prompting the initiation of outpatient physiotherapy. Initial evaluations (78 days post-surgery) revealed limited range of motion (ROM) in the knee joint, muscle weakness, and high levels of anxiety and fear of movement, as measured by patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Surface electromyography (EMG) further identified abnormal muscle activity in the semitendinosus muscle and medial head of the gastrocnemius. Outpatient physiotherapy was performed twice a week and focused on improving ROM, strengthening the quadriceps and hamstrings, performing knee ROM exercises and mobilization, and providing guidance on independent home training. At the final evaluation (118 days post-surgery), knee ROM improved, and the PROMs score demonstrated enhanced self-efficacy. However, anxiety and fear of movement persisted. In terms of muscle strength, no significant improvement was observed. Additionally, the swing phase was extended, and EMG during stair descent revealed increased muscle activity in the semitendinosus and medial head of the gastrocnemius, suggesting compensatory protective muscle activity due to residual fear of movement. In addition to physical factors, such as knee ROM and quadriceps muscle strength, psychosocial factors, such as fear, anxiety, and depression, are critical components influencing outcomes after TKA. Residual fear is believed to delay ROM improvement and contribute to protective-like muscle activity. This case highlights the importance of a comprehensive rehabilitation approach addressing both physical and psychological aspects to optimize functional recovery in TKA patients with a pronounced fear of movement.",Cureus,2025
40151712,Walking Ability After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Comprehensive Review.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly effective surgical intervention for alleviating pain and restoring function in patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Walking ability, a critical measure of post-operative success, directly impacts patients' independence, mobility, and quality of life. This review comprehensively examines the factors influencing walking ability after TKA, encompassing pre-operative, surgical, and post-operative considerations. Pre-operative factors, such as patient demographics, functional status, psychological well-being, and comorbidities, significantly shape post-operative outcomes. Surgical techniques, including the choice of approach, implant design, alignment, and minimally invasive or robotic-assisted methods, also play a pivotal role in determining walking ability. Post-operative rehabilitation, particularly early mobilization, physical therapy, and exercise protocol adherence, is essential for optimizing recovery. Long-term outcomes reveal that, while most patients experience significant improvements in walking ability, some face persistent limitations due to age, comorbidities, or suboptimal surgical results. Emerging technologies, such as wearable devices, robotic-assisted surgery, and personalized rehabilitation programs, offer promising avenues for enhancing post-operative walking ability. Biological augmentation techniques, like platelet-rich plasma and stem cell therapy, are also being explored to improve tissue healing and functional recovery. This review underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to maximize walking ability and overall satisfaction after TKA, synthesizing evidence from clinical studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Future research should focus on refining surgical techniques, advancing rehabilitation strategies, and integrating personalized medicine to improve outcomes.",Cureus,2025
